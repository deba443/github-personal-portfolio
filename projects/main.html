    <h3>Food ordering app details</h3>
    <p>ReactMeals was the name of the project. in this project I made a small food ordering app so that i can help user to order food online so that user time is saved.
    The pages which were given to me were the only landing page in that page we are going to see the meal item and the meal item which are stored in  cart and after going to cart we can change the amount of the meal iem.
    This web  application enables feature so that user can select food from the menu card and also can ordered food from online by this web app. after ordering food user will receive a confirmation message. By using this application the work of waiter is reduced or we can say that work is nullified. The benefit is that is there is a rush in a restaurant then there will be chances that the waiter will be unable to take the order and then the users can directly order the food by using web application.
